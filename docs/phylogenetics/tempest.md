# A note on TempEst and clock models

A common step in workflows of timed evolutionary analyses is an intuitive exploration of the strength of temporal signal by regressing root-to-tip distances versus sampling dates ([Hill and Baele](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31364710/); [Rambaut et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27774300/); [Rieux and Balloux](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26880113/)). It is, however, well-known that this ignores the partial covariances that follow from the shared ancestry between the investigated sequences, and that this can have difficult-to-predict consequences ([Drummond et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14711090/); [Duchene et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25771196/); [Murray et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27110344/); [Vrancken et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29026650/)). 

Despite these shortcomings, it remains a useful tool for data exploration. An often overlooked option is that by coloring the residuals by trait (e.g. host), one can visually identify persistent effects on the rate of evolution linked to that trait (and which may obscure the presence of temporal signal in the overall data set). Should you detect such instances, it may well be that the default relaxed clock model in BEAST is not be the best way to model the rate of evolution for the data set at hand. 

More generally, uncorrelated relaxed clock models can be misleading when discrete rate changes have introduced correlated rates of evolution (e.g. [influenza A virus evolution across hosts](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24531761/)). In other words: it seems that whenever there are strong and persistent lineage effects on the substitution rate, among lineage rate variation may not be well accommodated by a pure random effects relaxed
clock model. In such situations, mixed effects clock models ([Vrancken et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24699231/)) may more adequately model this aspect of the evolutionary history . Note that mixed effects models can also be of value for testing hypotheses about differences in evolutionary rates on particular branches and/or clades (e.g. [Patrono et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35538057/)).
