# Ordering office supplies (__laptop, external hard drive, ...__)

To order items from Apple, you have to make use of the procedure via the ULB-partner Econocom. First ask Simon to contact ulb@econocom.com so as to have them send you an email with the explanation of the procedure you need to follow. In brief, this entails browsing to the [Procurato website](https://education.procurato.store/ulb) and creating a login with your ULB email. You can then order the items you need and ask Simon to approve them. That's it. The status of the purchases can be tracked via the procurato-website.

Non-Apple items that can be found on the website of [Lyreco](https://www.lyreco.com/webshop/FRBE) can be ordered by letting Simon know what you need. 

Whatever you did not find via the above resources can be purchased, but youâ€™ll have to pre-finance them. Refunds also pass via Simon, giving him lots of pencil-and-paper joy. For this you need the order confirmation and a proof of payment, together with the ULB ID that can be found on your personnel card.
