# Practical aspects upon arriving

Below a brief guide made by SpELL members. For a more detailed guide, check the [International Welcome Desk](https://www.ulb.be/en/researchers-and-phds-coming-to-ulb) documentation.

## Badge

First, send an e-mail and a photo ID (in '.jpg' format) to Marianne Descheemaeker (<marie-anne.descheemaeker@ulb.be>, Service du personnel administratif, technique, de gestion et spécialisé - [SPATGS](https://www.ulb.be/fr/marianne-descheemaeker-1)) and then send an email to one of the following contacts to activate your badge (to get access to the building):

-	<badge.acces@ulb.be>
-	<jean-philippe.charlier@ulb.ac.be>
-	<anthony.mauclet@ulb.be>

## Housing 

For the first week/month you could stay at an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), but if you are planning to stay for 1-3 months in a temporary accommodation, it is advisable to look at [spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/). 
Longer-term accommodation can be searched for via [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/en) (--  other options?). 
Also, do not forget that the lab is at the La Plaine campus (not Solbosch, see map)!

## Phone number

If you do not have a European phone number and wish to have a Belgian one, you can either opt for a prepaid card or a plan.
For prepaid cards, you don't need a permanent address. They can easily be obtained at:

-	The airport where you pick up your luggage (Lyca Mobile)
-	Any BASE, Proximus or Orange store. 

If you want to get a plan, you need to provide an address. All operators have plans, some more expensive than others: [Mobile Vikings](https://mobilevikings.be/en/), BASE, Telenet, ... 

## Transportation card (MOBIB card)

It can be bought in a KIOSK or a BOOTIK or from the new red GO vending machines in the stations and at the main tram/bus stops. The purchase of this card does not require any formality. All information can be found [here](https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?_guid=d02c7fb6-3e9c-3810-248e-eec4ee5ebc8c&l=en).

## Register at the townhall

Everyone coming from outside Belgium must register at their accommodation townhall (Ixelles, Etterbeek, Schaerbeek, etc) and thus, provide an address. The easiest way is to contact Delphine Dieudonné (delphine.dieudonne@ulb.be) from the International Welcome desk at the ULB; she would ask for your information and copies of your passport and visa (if needed). Then, the police will visit you within 2 to 3 weeks to give you an appointment at the corresponding townhall.

## Bank account

There are multiple banks where you could get an account. However, if you don’t speak French or Dutch and/or you do not have a Belgian ID number, it is recommended to open the account in a bank where you would be able to communicate in English and open an account with your foreign ID. **You need to provide an address and your work contract or similar.** You could pick between:

-	[BNP Paribas Fortis](https://www.bnpparibasfortis.be/en/Customer-flow/Expats-enrolment?axes4=expa)
-	[ING](https://www.ing.be/en/retail/daily-banking/expats/expat-to-belgium)
-	[KBC](https://www.kbcbrussels.be/retail/en/processes/payments/currrent-account-expats/open-current-account-expat.html)
- ...

## Health insurance (_'mutuelle'_)

Contact Delphine Dieudonné (<delphine.dieudonne@ulb.be>) from the International Welcome Desk at ULB, she will help you to register to Paternamut. For this, you will need to fill a form with your address and bank account number (IBAN).

## Work contract
