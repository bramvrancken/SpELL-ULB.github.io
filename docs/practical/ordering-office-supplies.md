## Ordering office supplies

To order items from Apple (e.g. _laptop_), you have to make use of the procedure via the ULB-partner Econocom. First ask Simon to contact ulb@econocom.com so as to have them send you an email with the explanation of the procedure you need to follow. In brief, this entails browsing to the [Procurato website](https://education.procurato.store/ulb) and creating a login with your ULB email. You can then order the items you need and ask Simon to approve them. That's it. The status of the purchases can be tracked via the procurato-website.

Non-Apple items that are available on the website of [Lyreco](https://www.lyreco.com/webshop/FRBE) (e.g. _external hard drive_) can be ordered by letting Simon know what you need. 

Whatever you did not find via the above resources can be purchased, but youâ€™ll have to pre-finance them. Refunds also pass via Simon, giving him lots of pencil-and-paper joy. Do keep the order confirmation and a proof of payment, without you may miss out on the refund. Simon will need to add your ULB ID (which can be found on your personnel card).
