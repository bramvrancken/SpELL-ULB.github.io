# Contributing to Bioconda

Adding to Bioconda is a great way to distribute your software, however you can get lost on where to start and what every variable of the recipe means.

Here are three very good guidelines on how to write & maintain a Bioconda recipe:

1. [Adding bioinformatic software to Bioconda - a reference guide](https://ubinfie.github.io/2024/08/16/adding-to-bioconda-quickguide.html)
2. [Debugging a Bioconda build - a reference guide](https://ubinfie.github.io/2024/08/16/debugging-bioconda-build-quickguide.html)
3. [Updating bioinformatic software on Bioconda - a reference guide](https://ubinfie.github.io/2024/08/16/updating-bioconda-recipe-quickguide.html)

These guides are written by the [Âµbinfie (The microbial bioinformatics community, on github!)](https://ubinfie.github.io/) a microbioinformatics community with long-time contributors & maintainers of Bioconda and other bioinformatics tools.
