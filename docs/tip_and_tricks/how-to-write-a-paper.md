# How to write a paper

!!! info "All credits go to Kristian G. Andersen"
    This is a copy of a document composed by Kristian G. Andersen, Scripps Research


## Overview

- Start now. This is the hardest part, so get started early.
- Focus initially on your one main finding - why is this study so interesting, why is it so important?
Your main finding drives those questions.
- Don’t try to do everything in one study. Make sure the paper describes a linear tight story where
you nail one big question/innovation/advance. Of course, to do so, there will be many more
questions you need to address as part of the study, but it always needs to come back to that one
big thing.
- Before you start writing, sketch out the subheadings of your paper (even if the journal doesn’t
require them) - what are the main sections required to write a compelling story?
- As you write your paper, focus more on the findings, as opposed to what you did. People are very
good at writing about what they did, but distilling that into succinct and important findings is
much harder - but all the more critical.
- Write everything in active voice - never use passive voice.
- Stick to just one tense - either past or present (I prefer the former).
- Minimize the use of abbreviations (e.g., use “Lassa virus” and not “LASV”).
- Be consistent throughout so you don’t confuse the reader - e.g., use either "United States", "U.S." or "US" - not a mix of all three. Make sure concepts are clear and consistent throughout - e.g., "genomic epidemiology", "molecular epidemiology", "sequencing-based surveillance", "sequencing-based epidemiology" or "variant", "strain", "lineage", "mutant", etc. Introduce each concept/term and stick to it throughout - not a mixture of terms that describe the same thing.
- Keep your writing simple, concise, and to the point - don’t try to hide unclear thinking using convoluted sentences and fancy words or jargon.

## Title

The title should convey two critical things - what did the study do, and what is your one main finding?

## Abstract

Be honest about your study in the abstract - don’t try to sell your study as something it is not. Understand that the abstract is the single most important part of the paper - it’s read by the editor so they can understand its importance, and it’s read by a reviewer so they can get a good sense of what they might be able to poke holes in! Focus on the importance of the study - what did we really learn from this study, and why should we really care? It’s critical to get those things clearly and succinctly across.

An eﬀective abstract should have the following key sections:

- Brief background of the field
- What is the main question/problem addressed by the study
- How did you address the main question/problem
- What are the key findings
- Why are your key findings so important
- What is the broader perspective of the study - what have we learned, where do we go next

## Introduction

- Start with two-three paragraphs of background to the study - what is the field, what are the questions, why are they important? Make sure both lay readers and experts get enough information to understand the whole study.
- One paragraph about the study itself:
	- What are the questions
	- What did you do
	- What are the main findings
	- What is the overall conclusion of the study

## Results

Always divide the results section into sub-sections with headings - even if you’re ultimately going to throw out the subheadings themselves if the journal doesn't allow them. For each sub-section:

- Subtitle - have the Subtitle be the main finding of the section, not what you did.
- Paragraph 1
	-One to two sentences with background. Make sure you link back to the previous section (or prior research)
	- What is the question, problem, or hypothesis?
	- "We did XX and we found YY"
	- one (or two) sentence(s) focusing on the main method, finding, and conclusion in this section
- Paragraph 1 to n
	- Details about what was done and what was found. Focus on short paragraphs addressing
specific things - not a long paragraph with a lot of details
- Brief conclusion of the section
- Lead-in to the next section

## Discussion

Focus on discussing your findings, not summarizing your findings - you can summarize in a short paragraph up front. What are the things you couldn’t address with your study? What are the caveats? What’s new in this study versus previous studies - agreement or disagreement? How does your study fit into the broader context of the field? Conclude with an overall conclusion of the study, how it has moved the field, and what is next for others (or you!) to do. Use subtitles to structure your discussion section.

## Methods

Make sure methods are really clear so others can follow them. It is fine to write the methods in passive voice, but make sure you stick to just one - active or passive.

- Make sure you provide enough details for somebody else to reproduce your results - experiments and analyses.
- Make ALL raw data available - make sure data has been deposited on NCBI, including the SRA, GenBank, etc.
- Create a single github for each paper containing:
	- All intermediary data files - e.g. alignments, trees, xml files, tables, etc.
	- High resolution figures in vector format
	- Relevant scripts to generate and analyze the data
	- Include a helpful readme file linking to the paper, raw data not on the github, etc.
