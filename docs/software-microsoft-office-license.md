# Microsoft Office suite licence

Many among us use online document editors like Google Docs or Microsoft 365 to collaborate on papers. But there is a growing concern about Big Tech having access to your content, tracking you across the web, and collecting data. Their softwares and hardwares usually (or always?) are very privacy-intrusive. Which is the reason why [Microsoft's Office 365 was declared illegal for German schools](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/28/microsoft-365-faces-darkening-gdpr-compliance-clouds-after-german-report/), and why [Gmail, Chromebooks and Google Workspace are not welcome in Danish schools](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/18/denmark-bans-chromebooks-and-google-workspace-in-schools-over-gdpr/) and [similar bans have been put in place in Dutch schools and universities](https://tuta.com/blog/dutch-schools-must-stop-using-google-email-and-cloud-services).
For those who care: more detailed information can be found in the referenced articles. 

The ULB, nonetheless, provides a Microsoft Office suite licence. The default license is of type A1, which for example does not allow editing files/docs downloaded to your computer. Personnel of the category ‘Scientifique - Personnel de tiers’, such as postdocs funded by the FNRS, can upgrade the default license to overcome such inconveniences.
A request to upgrade to an A3 licence free of charge can be made via this [webform](https://support.ulb.be/web/support/-/comment-demander-des-acces-a-des-ressources-numeriques-ulb-pour-moi-meme-ou-pour-un-collaborateur-?inheritRedirect=true&redirect=%2Ffr%2Fweb%2Fsupport%2F-%2Fi-am-a-staff-member.-how-to-get-access-to-ulb-digital-ressources-for-an-external-member-).
An overview of all things one can have access to is provided via this [link](https://support.ulb.be/en/web/support/-/am-qu-est-ce-que-c-est/). 

But know that free and well-developed alternatives exist (although the look and feel is perhaps less modern), such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
