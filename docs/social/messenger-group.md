# Contact details SpELL members

There's a SpELL Whatsapp group that is used to disseminate all sorts of intersting scientific news. 

The author of this text is convinced that we should use Signal instead of Whatsapp, though you might wonder why as all messages are end-to-end encrypted. Indeed, the issue is not the message's content, but the additional information that is collected by Meta. Specifically, Meta asks access to your contacts, meaning they know all people you are or have been in contact with as well as their phone number. Meta also keeps track of all metadata (with whom you interact, how often and at what times of day) to further refine the profile they build on you and your contacts. While there's no direct harm in this[^1], it does enable Meta to increase their revenue. In turn, this helps maintain their dominant position in this era of surveillance capitalism and all the downsides that come with it. For those who want to get a feeling of how intrusive data collection actually is (some would outright call this spying), this [research paper](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/Android_privacy_report.pdf), this [overview of Google data collection](https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/google-data-collection.pdf) and this [interview with Shoshana Zuboff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIXhnWUmMvw) on surveillance capitalism are good starting points.

    at least if you're not involved in dangerous activities: [the former head of the NSA        outright admits people are killed based on metadata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL8_caB35Pg).
    But fortunately, he also tells that's not what our metadata is used for... :rolling_eyes:
