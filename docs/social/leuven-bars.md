Given Simon's and Bram's history in Philippe Lemey's group at the Rega institute, it may not come as a surprise that we can include tips for drinks in Leuven :smiley:

Some bars that people in Philippe's group are fond of:

-   [Malz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fJxF2T5ZEFBVTpy7) (lots and lots of local beers)
-   [Metafoor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ySan7TcTM72eVGXQ6) (really, only one is fond of this but she drags everyone here).
-   [Giraf](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pMujoQdiuQQYFBA17) (famous in our lab for shots with bugs in it!)
